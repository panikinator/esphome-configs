# ESPHome Configurations

This repository contains **my personal** ESPHome YAML configuration files for various DIY devices used with Home Assistant. These files are probably only useful to others for reference and inspiration but you do you.

> **Note:** These configs are tailored to my own hardware and environment. They are **not ready-to-use** for other setups. If you wish to use them, you must review and adapt them for your own devices and requirements. Sensitive data (like `secrets.yaml`) is not included.
